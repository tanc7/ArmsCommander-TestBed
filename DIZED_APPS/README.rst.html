"Dized" stands for Daemonized Applications.

We use the term daemonzied because we implement a combination of open and proprietary technologies (hardware and coding libraries) to enable...
<ul>
<li>the malware we generate
</li><li>the hardware that supports and runs this malware
</li><li>the attacker who uses the toolkits and C2 (Command-and-Control Systems)
</li><li>and the target who (unwillingly) has become it's victim
</li></ul>

to adopt the characteristics of...
<ol><li>  <b>All of the basic traits of a APT (Advanced Persistent Threat characteristics)</b>, whose goal is to maintain access rather than the typical "in-and-out exfiltration plan"
</li><li>  to have the malware retain some degree of <b>"autonomy"</b>
</li><li>  <b>and some degree of "invulnerability"</b> (e.g. fork itself to evade destruction by antivirus, firewalls, IDS/IPS, heuristic scanners and can repeatedly regenerate itself from "actual deaths" by becoming a actual UNIX Daemon)
</li><li>  <b>and some degree of "self-sufficiency"</b> (e.g. capable of performing rudimentary fuzz-testing)
</li><li>  <b>and some degree of "evolution" by stress-induced response</b> (e.g. the malware is aware that there are no known documented vulnerabilities that it can exploit and it must discover a vulnerability on it's own accord. It will begin fuzz-testing and attempt to replicate "Proof-of-Concept" code into copies of itself, test that PoC, and report back to it's master)
</li><li>  <b>obviously a FULL degree of "stealth-and-obfuscation-options".</b> This means, it should be capable of producing a complete client process of ANY known tunneling protocol, standalone, wrapped, encapsulated, known and unknown. (e.g. SSH tunneling, UDP tunneling, DNS tunneling, virtual, SSL, UDP-over-TCP, VPN-over-SSH, TCP-over-SOCKS, TCP-over-HTTPS)
</li><li>  <b>In order to have a better chanc</b>e at evading the Intrusion Detection System after we already snuck past it's Ingress Filtering Rules, Intrusion Prevention System, killed the Anti-Virus, compromised the Firewall, Escalated Privileges to ROOT/SYSTEM, established Persistence, Compromised Patching Systems, Pivoted to it's neighbors in the Internal Network.
</li><li>  And to always <b>"maintain a advantage against the White Hats"*</b>
</li></ol>
*I am only saying this to refer to the Blue Team in a penetration test.

<h4>Current Projects
</h4>
<h4>STARTED DEVELOPMENT:"GROWING-PAINS":
</h4>  Automated Internal Fuzzing Service & "Zero-Day Discovery Tool" & Primative Proof-of-Concept Generator. Portable Malware Version & Client.

<h4>NOT STARTED:"EBOLAIDS":
</h4>  Command-and-Control (C2) for GROWING-PAINS. Unlike GP, Ebolaids retains a full development library, debugger, packet analyzer and should be able to compile binaries for any architecture, and any operating system (see Mirai botnet source code, they got nasty stuff for any processor or platform).

  It functions as the server in the relationship between the emergent malware and itself and provides a means of communication and job allocation for the malware.

<h4>DEVELOPMENT STAGE**:"INCANTATION":
</h4>  Automated Wireless Handshake-Capturing and Post-Exploitation Toolkit. WPA2-PSK and WPA2-MGT/ENT.

<p>  As of 12/19/17, the planned release next-year contains several portions, a Routersploit backbone(https://github.com/reverse-shell/routersploit), a modified API-to-CLI interface, credential parser, integration with other tools such as wpa_supplicant, wicd_curses/wicd_cli, rsf, dotdotpwn, metasploit scripts, and customized options catered specifically for the $30 Raspberry Pi micro-computer(https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/), which is the intended host of this toolkit.

  A subproject involves automatically running captured hashes into the project listed right after, auto-parsing the cracked credentials, and storing it back into the Raspberry Pi. Making abusing cracked passwords as easy as plugging in power and bringing the Pi home.

  And using this will be as easy as running the installer, dropping off the Pi within wireless access range of the target, and picking up the dropbox six to twelve hours later***.

  ***Assuming you use the recommended idea of a portable battery pack as a power supply. The same ones used to recharge your phone on the go.</p>

<h4>NEAR COMPLETION:"DICK-FORGE":
</h4>  Fully Automatic Password Cracker with a Hashcat Base and capable of processing rulesets and customized attack binaries (PRINCEPROCESSOR). Integrates with CRON daemons and systemd processes. Auto-traverses your specified directories to search for more untouched hashes (passwords) to crack.

  Auto-optimizes itself in response to errors discovered from the proprietary NVidia driver installation process.

<h4>NOT STARTED:"BLACK-CHANTING-GROWS":
</h4>  Tunneling Method Library and Automater.
<h4>NOT STARTED:"SUNSPEAR":
</h4>  Automated Log Parsing and Analysis. Auto-adapting Cybersecurity measures to prevent discovery by the responding Incident Response Team.


**Research was completed last week. Everything that is needed is already available. But no one had rolled anything out that is practical yet. So I am getting started on working on this.

<h4>Our Current Environment.
</h4>
<p>Developers have tried for decades in attempting to make malware and computer viruses as close if not exactly identical to the biological definition of a computer virus. All of them have failed in some respect. Particularly, the AI part was harder than expected to implement and "unpredictable mutation" of actual biological viruses. https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/27976/would-it-ever-be-possible-for-computer-viruses-to-evolve-new-genes-to-allow-th

However, a lot of these demands have been met, SEPARATELY, and with DIFFERENCES in scope by various exploit toolkits, security firms like Rapid7, and by GitHub Developers, such as Pupy. The "evolution" portion was answered somewhat by toolkits such as Veil-Evasion (changing signature), PSScrambler (targeted towards MS Windows Portal Executable .exe formats) and Metasploit msfvenom (changes other operating characteristics, most importantly the way the traffic looks on a IDS). But it was definitely not automated. And such exploits must constantly be rediscovered, reimplemented, and republished on GitHub and the Kali Linux APT Repos when the security patches roll in.

And thats what I call a pain-in-the-ass.</p>

<h4>Asking for Help from Contributors.
</h4>
<p>I highly doubt that a single person like me could actually finish this project. I reaally do need outside help and I could appreciate some talented developers out there in the field. I accept anyone, regardless of experience level, as long as they understand at least one language or background, whether it be Python/Ruby-on-Rails, C & Assembly, Encryption/Obfuscation, Network Engineering etc., if you have time to pitch in your contribution to the project I would really appreciate it.

I never intended for this idea to ever take off. But hopefully it'll inspire a greater effort to get some future project up and going. I just want to see this goal be realized with or without me.
</p>

<h4>Difference between this and release version of Arms-Commander and Cylon-Raider:
</h4>
<p>This is a significant digression from the intents of ArmsCommander, which is a collection of penetration test tools to make the pentester's job EASIER. ArmsCommander never automated the entire processs of the actual EXPLOITATION, PAYLOAD DELIVERY, EXFILTRATION, etc. All AC did was, help you "get-in" and find out "which doors are unlocked". I never thought much of the "getting-out-part" but as I applied more time
into fine-tuning my exfiltration techniques I had a growing urge to share these tactics to the community.</p>
