#### because of all of this, you must instqall routersploit intoa  PATH directory, in other words...
### /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or soemthing like that
### you then have to place your injector right into the path so that its executable and python can find it. SO...

### /usr/local/bin/routersploit/command_injector.py
## nevermind! I made it automated. It'll automatically generate a duplicate copy of the script to do its deeds.


### in return, assuming you wrote a script for it, you can immediately automate post-exploitation as soon as the pi boots up

#### For every one of the modules. you also needed to import this crqazy shit. IT helps in getting the ungraspable modules back. But we just want to reach their custom shel since we can easily learn their syntax.




### at this point you shoudl ahve the ability to directly access your interpreter from the root of the installation directory.
### we need also a logger of our own.

# Heres the reason why it wont work: https://docs.python.org/2/library/weakref.html
# The weakref module allows the Python programmer to create weak references to objects.
#
# In the following, the term referent means the object which is referred to by a weak reference.
#
# A weak reference to an object is not enough to keep the object alive: when the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, garbage collection is free to destroy the referent and reuse its memory for something else. A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects, where itâ€™s desired that a large object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping.
# because...
    # the author chcose to use weakrefs
    # the entire RSF framework is absed on the usage of weakrefs...
    # and at that point the weakref cannot be used elsewhere, we have little options for a display to see the captured creds.

# however....

# we can inject code into RSF installations to INTERCEPT the values BEFORE they get converted
    # but the variables will have NO VALUE. It only gets assigned a value as a weakref

#
# documentation implies that the weakref system creates TWO objects, a weakref OBJECT and the original data type, whether it be STRING, INTEGER, ETC. At some point the original thing would be deleted I guess. DOn't want it to crash you know?
# In my notes of thread_tap. it says..
# we have two arrays. It will be printed after the text gets matched up.

#############DOCUMENTATION ON WEAK REF STRUCTURE
# Something about weak refs
# """Changed in version 3.2: Added support for thread.lock, threading.Lock, and code objects.
#
# Several built-in types such as list and dict do not directly support weak references but can add support through subclassing:
#
# class Dict(dict):
#     pass
#
# obj = Dict(red=1, green=2, blue=3)   # this object is weak referenceable
#***Allows the printing of the object basically.... we can have it iterated BEFORE the object is passed.
# Other built-in types such as tuple and int do not support weak references even when subclassed (This is an implementation detail and may be different across various Python implementations.).
#
# Extension types can easily be made to support weak references; see Weak Reference Support."""

# DEBUG: """"Return a weak reference to object. The original object can be retrieved by calling the reference object if the referent is still alive; if the referent is no longer alive, calling the reference object will cause None to be returned. If callback is provided and not None, and the returned weakref object is still alive, the callback will be called when the object is about to be finalized; the weak reference object will be passed as the only parameter to the callback; the referent will no longer be available.
# DEBUG: So basically there are two things like key-value pairs in a dictionary. WE have a referent and a reference object,
# DEBUG: Unlike dictionaries, the key will "die" when the object gets passed.
# DEBUG:  SO parameters and args must hbe itereated and printed BEFORE.
# DEBUG: I think the dev also used hashables.
# DEBUG: SO it looks like there is no logging supoiorted for weakrefs. but we can still LOG the values by iterating them qwith callbacks BEFORE they get passed to something.


# DEBUG: because each file has ONE weakref with its own dicts and values, we can make a new module to ITERATE through each file's references, call the callbacks and then log them.
